# Share-Bike-Redistribution
## A class project with Haoyuan Song
Citi Bike is New York Cityâ€™s bike share system. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips. People use bike share to commute to work or school, run errands, get to appointments or social engagements, and more. But the distribution of Citi Bike is not as appropriate for people to use, thus we try to calculate a method for the company to move bikes to maximize the utilization of the bicycle and gain the more profits.
